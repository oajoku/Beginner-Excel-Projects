Description:
This section delves into using Excel’s financial functions PMT and IPMT to calculate monthly payments and interest payments.

PMT: Calculates loan payments based on a constant interest rate and term.
IPMT: Calculates interest portions of loan payments for a given period.

Challenges:


Initially, understanding how to apply these formulas in various scenarios was tricky. I struggled with ensuring proper input of arguments and ensuring consistent results.
The distinction between calculating monthly vs. yearly payments required attention, particularly in adjusting the rate and term correctly (i.e., dividing the rate by 12 for monthly payments).

✔️Successes:
Despite the challenges, I successfully applied both formulas to real-world business use cases. Understanding these formulas will be invaluable in financial analysis and planning.
