Description:


This section showcases the use of macros to automate repetitive tasks. The main macros I created include:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üü¢ Bring in a Picture: Automates inserting and resizing an image within a defined area.


üü¢ Calculate Average: Automates the calculation of the average across selected cells.


üü¢ Relative Referencing Test: Tests how macros handle relative references between cells.

Observations:


Challenges:


I struggled with inserting images using macros. Initially, I set the macro key to Ctrl + Shift + R but faced issues. After three attempts (with Ctrl + Shift + Q and Ctrl + Shift + X), I successfully brought in a picture and resized it.
Relative referencing was another challenge for me. It caused the macro to act on unintended cells (resulting in "#Div/0!" errors), likely because the macro keys were locked to the initial cells in the macros workbook.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issues Encountered:
I documented all questions and problems I faced along the way, such as difficulties with relative referencing, macros not working as expected, and confusion over Excel selecting the wrong cells. These problems were resolved with persistence and further practice.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lessons Learned:


I discovered that relative referencing requires precise cell selections and still needs practice understanding this concept.
I attempted to use macro keys in a standard Excel workbook, but there was confusion when Excel selected empty cells in other columns. After further testing, I realized this issue stemmed from locked keys in the macros workbook.

‚è∞Future Goal:


[x]   Improve my understanding and usage of relative referencing in Excel macros.
