##Overview
This repository contains my navigation pane exercise file that I created as part of my excel learning journey!üòÑ
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Process
üü•I learned about creating the navigation pane exercise during my course. 
üü•I applied the techniques to create my own navigation pane in Excel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##StepsüóíÔ∏è
1. I started by opening a new Excel worksheet and setting up the initial structure.
2. I clicked the plus sign at the bottom of the page to create two new worksheets, calling them "sheet 2" and "sheet 3".
3. I then zoomed into the worksheet to enlarge and highlight the details.
4. I proceeded to highlight the worksheet and fill it in with colour.
5. The colour I decided to use wasn't available in the colour palette so I decided to use the HEX code.
6. The colour choice was #C9A959.
7. I started by selecting cells D3 and E3 and adding the colour fill before adding the "Welcome to the..." message.
8. After putting in the message, I selected cells D4 and E4, so that I could input the "Navigation Pane" message.
9. I then chose the rounded rectangle form from the Excel ribbon's shapes selection.
10. I double-clicked the shape and proceeded to fill in the colour.
11. The colour I used was #F67280.
12. After I filled in the rectangle, I proceeded to double-click inside the bar to type in the "SHEET 2" message.
13. In order to align the "SHEET 2" message in the centre of the rectangle, I then left the "install" area of the ribbon and returned to the "home" section.
14. I highlighted the "SHEET 2" message again and changed the font to "AVENIR", as that was my preferred choice of font.
15. I wanted to further improve the image of my rounded rectangle, so I double-clicked and selected "format shape" from the dropdown.
16. Among the possibilities, I chose "3D Format". I chose the "top bevel" dropdown when it became available, which let me choose the first item from the various choices.
17. I made a modest adjustment by reducing the width and height to three points once the 3D design was established.
18. I exited from the "format shape" option and went on to double-click the rectangle again.
19. This revealed the dropdown once more.
20. I chose "this document," "edit hyperlink," and "sheet 2" under "cell reference" when prompted.
21. Following my "okay" click, the "sheet 2" worksheet was immediately linked to the "SHEET 2" rectangle. 
22. This indicates that a user will be instantly referred to the "sheet 2" worksheet if they click on the "SHEET 2" button (rounded rectangle).
23. To recreate the same thing for "SHEET 3", I double-clicked the "SHEET 2" button.
24. I clicked "copy" and pasted it beneath "SHEET 2".
25. I changed the name of the button from "SHEET 2" to "SHEET 3".
26. I didn't have to repeat the same process as this was a shortcut.
27. Once more, I double-clicked the background and chose "edit hyperlink" from the dropdown menu.
28. I opted to use "this document" and chose "sheet 3" from the selection of "cell references."
29. Again, automatically linking both parties together.
30. When these buttons were finished, I went to the worksheet "sheet 2" and used the shape dropdown list to choose an oval.
31. I colour-filled this shape with the HEX code #F67280.
32. I typed in the word "NAV" after double-clicking the oval once again.
33. I exited the "insert" icon and clicked the "home" icon to centre the message properly.
34. After doing so, I double-clicked the oval and chose "edit hyperlink" so that I could opt for "NAV" under "cell reference".
35. As a result, "sheet 2" and the "NAV" page were automatically linked.
36. I edited the oval in "3D format" as well. To make it less conspicuous, the width and height as previously mentioned were lowered to three points.
37. I highlighted the "NAV" message and increased the size.
38. The ‚ÄúNAV‚Äù button for the worksheet "sheet 3" was created using the same procedure once again.
39. Finally, I created an oval shape on the "NAV" page by scrolling down to the bottom of the area I had chosen to work with for this project.
40. I went on to include an arrow from the "shapes" dropdown menu by double-clicking.
41. I highlighted the arrow and made sure to put it in the centre of the oval.
42. Additionally, I chose "white" from the colour drops menu to fill in the arrow.
43. 44. After completing this, I was able to double-click the arrow and the oval at the same time by depressing the "command" key.
45. A drop-down list appeared and I clicked the "group" option.
46. This "group" option merged the arrow and oval together.
47. After that, I double-clicked to alter the hyperlink once more, choosing "NAV" from the "cell reference" selection to link the oval to the "NAV" page.
48. If a user wanders off, the arrow button helps to redirect them to the top of the page!üòÉ
