Employee Productivity and Performance Dashboard
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project aimed to analyze employee productivity and performance using Excel's advanced features, including Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and conditional formatting. Additionally, the project incorporated the Data Analysis ToolPak for descriptive statistics and explored Power BI for enhanced visualizations. The objective was to create an interactive dashboard providing actionable insights into employee performance, departmental productivity, and role-based comparisons.



Dataset Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset was designed to simulate HR data, including the following key variables:



Employee ID: Unique identifier for each employee.


Department: Departments such as Sales, IT, HR, etc.


Job Role: Specific roles within departments.


Training Hours Worked: Proxy metric for employee engagement and productivity.


Performance Metrics: Productivity scores derived from normalized training hours.


Due to the absence of direct productivity data, training hours worked were normalized using the min-max normalization formula to ensure fair comparisons:

Normalized Score


=


Training Hours


−


Min


Max


−


Min


Normalized Score= 


Max−Min


Training Hours−Min

Steps and Features


1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Handled missing data by imputing with average values to preserve dataset integrity.
Normalized training hours to create a consistent productivity score.


2. Pivot Tables and Charts
Pivot Tables were created to:
Analyze productivity by department and job role.
Summarize average productivity metrics for comparison.
Pivot Charts were used to visualize trends:
Bar charts for department-level comparisons.
Line charts for trends in training hours and productivity.


3. Conditional Formatting
Applied color scales to highlight top-performing employees and departments.
Enhanced dashboard interactivity with slicers, allowing filtering by department or role.


4. Descriptive Statistics (Data Analysis ToolPak)
Calculated mean, standard deviation, and variability of employee productivity scores.
Highlighted performance trends and areas needing improvement.


5. Power BI Exploration (Planned)
While time constraints prevented full integration, Power BI was considered for:
Advanced, interactive visuals (e.g., heatmaps, scatterplots).
Enhanced drill-down capabilities.

Key Insights
Departmental Productivity: 

Variability was evident across departments, with certain teams outperforming others.
Role-based Productivity: 

Specific job roles showed consistently higher productivity, suggesting opportunities for targeted training or resource allocation.
Employee Distribution: 

Slicers and Pivot Tables allowed interactive exploration of employee performance by role and department, aiding decision-making.
