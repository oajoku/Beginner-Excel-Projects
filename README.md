# Beginner-Excel-Projects
Background Information
Hello and welcome to my repository!
About Me
I recently received my degree in business administration, and I'm now trying to make the move into the tech industry. I'm keen to pick up new skills, like Excel, and eventually combine my knowledge of business administration with these newly acquired technical proficiencies.
Purpose of this repository
This repository reflects my dedication to personal development. In order to develop my technological foundation and eventually go on to more complex projects, I will be focusing on simpler projects here initially. I think my technical expertise and business background will make me eligible for special opportunities, and I'm eager to investigate this intersection.
Along the road, I'll be documenting my learning as well. This is a place where I can learn from mistakes, iterate, and grow —it's not just a display of what I've accomplished.  Although I'm not an expert, I'm committed to working hard to master these new abilities.
