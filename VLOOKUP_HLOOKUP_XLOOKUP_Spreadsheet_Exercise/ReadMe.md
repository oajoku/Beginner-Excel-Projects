# VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, & XLOOKUP Spreadsheet

## Description
This project explores the use of VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and XLOOKUP functions in Excel. These functions were applied to different datasets to efficiently retrieve information from rows and columns.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for creating the spreadsheet and implementing the formulas.
- **OneDrive**: Used for online storage and collaboration.

## Functions Implemented
- **VLOOKUP**: Used to search for a value in the first column of a table and return a value in the same row from another column.
- **HLOOKUP**: Used to search for a value in the first row of a table and return a value in the same column from another row.
- **XLOOKUP**: A more flexible function that searches both vertically and horizontally.

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding the differences between the three lookup functions and when to use each.
- Handling errors such as **#N/A** when the lookup value was not found in the table.
- Adjusting the column and row ranges to ensure the correct data was retrieved.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my understanding of lookup functions and their practical applications in data analysis and Excel automation.
